1) wageningen cron [LOW]
    Downloads the last week of met station data, and adds it to the netcdf file
    No problem if it fails, as long as it succeeds once a week

2) veenkampen cron [LOW]
    Downloads the station data of the Veenkampen, and adds it to the netcdf file
    No problem if it fails; data not used at all. MAQ probably has their own (and better) archive.

3) watertemp cron [MEDIUM]
    Download all water temp observations from the website of Rijkswaterstaat.
    Will download a single timestep (ie. most recent one on the website).

4) forecast cron [MEDIUM]
    Converts all downloaded watertemp observations to netcdf, and copies the file to surf sara to be used in the forecast.
    The temperatures will be interpolated for the forecast; if this cron job fails the forecast will be the SSTs from the GFS (ie. lower temperatures in summer)
   



Real time forecasting setup:
===========================

=====

 $ crontab -l
0   2  * * * /home/escience/forecast/cron_post.sh     -> WRFV3/tools/forecast/post.job
0   4  * * * /home/escience/forecast/cron_plot.sh     
0   9  * * * /home/escience/forecast/cron_prepare.sh  -> WRFV3/tools/forecast/prepare.job
0  12  * * * /home/escience/forecast/cron_run.sh      -> WRFV3/tools/forecast/run.job


    
6) cron_plot [MEDIUM]
    Copies the plots from the SURFSara archive /projects/0/sitc/archie/YYYY/MM/DD/*png to the web server.
    Website is hosted by a machine from Kees (ask him about details).
    The filesystem is mounted (NFS) at maq06:/shared/website
    the site is then in the Summerinthecity subdirectory.

Locations on cartesius
======================

RUNDIR
    /home/jattema/WRF/WRFV3/run
WPSDIR
    /home/jattema/WRF/WPS
Archive
    A run is archived on the cartesius on the project filesystem (1 TB, expires ~june 2016).
    The home dir has a (low) qutoa.
SST
    /home/jattema/SST


Actions to take
===============

    0) check if a new run appears on the website

    If so, no need to take any action (even if it crashes, and only shows plots for the first few hours).
    The at least the archiving of the input boundaries was successful.
    If not, see why not (check the slurm* files on the cartesius in the home dir (for GFS download) and RUNDIR (for the rest).
    You can also check the email on maq06 using 'mail'... lots of mails (~5) per day even if things are ok.

    1) check free space in home (weekly)

    If the home disk is getting full (basically, ~ weekly, there should be enough space for a few weeks, to be sure)
    Move the GFS boundaries to the archive:
        from: /home/jattema/GFS
        to:   /projects/0/sitc/GFS

    2) check if boundaries are downloaded (daily / weekly)

    GFS boundaries are hosted on a webserver. I did not manage to find a way to download arbitrary dates, only the last month or so is online.
    If downloading fails, manually download the missing days. The forecast script accepts a date to download.


    



===========================
Re-forecasting setup:
===========================

 $ crontab -l
MAILTO=escience
0   3,9,15,21  * * * /home/escience/forecast/fc_spawn.sh
0   6,18       * * * /home/escience/forecast/fc_reap.sh

0   9  * * * /home/escience/forecast/cron_prepare.sh


A lot of the complexity of the setup has been moved into two new scripts: 
fc_spawn.sh
    Looks in WRF/WRFv3 directory, finds the most recent job (ie. YYYY-MM-DD directory), and
    checks if a new run can be started, ie. the netcdf file contains the timestep required for cycling.
    It can be run as often as you want, i suggest every few hours or so.

fc_reap.sh
    Looks in the WRF/WRFv3 directory, finds all finished runs by reading the last line in the rsl.out.0000
    file in a YYYY-MM-DD directory. If it contains 'wrf: SUCCESS COMPLETE WRF'; an archive job
    is put on the queue. Do not run them too quickly after eachother, but give them some time to start.
    Run it once or twice a day.

The two scripts can work concurrently, but there can be a race condition where one jobs tries to
read a netCDF for cycling, but another job has just moved the file to the archive.
Therefore, run then somewhat apart.
